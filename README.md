# 🛡 Sentinel AI v2  
### Quantum-Resistant Detection Engine for DigiByte  
### *(Layer 1 of the 5‑Layer DigiByte Quantum Shield)*  
**By @Darek_DGB**

---

## 🚀 Overview  
Sentinel AI v2 is the **first line of defense** in the DigiByte Quantum Shield — a 5‑layer protection architecture designed to detect, validate, and defend against advanced threats, including early signs of quantum‑assisted attacks.

Sentinel AI v2 monitors DigiByte’s chain behaviour in real time and identifies anomalies that indicate:  
- entropy collapse  
- nonce‑reuse  
- mempool manipulation  
- timestamp irregularities  
- synthetic quantum‑like probes  
- stealth reorg patterns  

It is the **eyes and intuition** of the entire shield.

## 🔵 How Sentinel AI v2 Fits Into the Full Quantum Shield

```
Detection → Validation → Defense → Wallet Protection → PQC Gate
 (Sentinel AI)     (DQSN)       (ADN v2)        (Guardian)    (Quantum Wallet Guard)
```

Sentinel AI v2 sends structured threat signals to:  
- **DQSN**, which validates whether the threat is global or local  
- **ADN v2**, which executes defensive actions  
- **Guardian Wallet**, which protects funds in high‑risk events  

---

## 🧠 Key Features  
### ✔ Real-Time Anomaly Detection  
High‑resolution monitoring of 64‑block windows for entropy & behavioural drift.

### ✔ Local vs Global Threat Classification  
Communicates with DQSN to confirm whether anomalies are isolated or widespread.

### ✔ Weighted Risk System  
Produces risk states:  
- NORMAL  
- ELEVATED  
- HIGH  
- CRITICAL  

### ✔ Autonomous Escalation  
Automatically signals ADN v2 when HIGH risk is confirmed.

### ✔ Testable Architecture  
Fully compatible with unit tests, smoke tests, and virtual attack simulations.

## 🧪 Virtual Attack Simulation  
A full coordinated attack was executed against all 5 layers of the Quantum Shield.

The attacker attempted:  
- fake quantum‑like anomalies  
- DQSN poisoning  
- ADN safe‑mode disable  
- Guardian Wallet breach  
- CPU/log/network overload

Sentinel AI v2 **successfully detected every anomaly**, escalated the threat, and triggered ADN v2’s protective reflex.

## 🛠 Tests & Validation  
Sentinel AI v2 includes:

### ✔ Smoke Tests  
Basic integrity tests to verify correct startup & component stability.  
`tests/test_smoke.py`

### ✔ Full Attack Simulation  
High‑fidelity red‑team scenario with a multi‑vector coordinated attack.

## 🌐 Part of the DigiByte Quantum Shield  
Sentinel AI v2 is one component of a larger protection mesh:

- **Layer 1:** Sentinel AI v2 (Detection)  
- **Layer 2:** DQSN (Validation)  
- **Layer 3:** ADN v2 (Defense Reflex)  
- **Layer 4:** Guardian Wallet v2 (Wallet Protection)  
- **Layer 5:** Quantum Wallet Guard (PQC Gate)  

Together these form an autonomous, self‑correcting, quantum‑resistant defense system.

---

## ⚡ Vision Statement  
Sentinel AI v2 exists to give DigiByte **the most advanced and adaptive security layer in the blockchain ecosystem**.

A future where chains defend themselves —  
where threats are detected before damage begins —  
where wallets protect their owners in real time —  
and where DigiByte leads the world in trustless security.

This is the vision.  
This is the path.  
This is the beginning.
